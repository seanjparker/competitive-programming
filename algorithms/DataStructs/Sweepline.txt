A sweepline algorithm models the problem as a set of events processed in sorted order
To find the max number of people in a place at the same time, given entrance and leaving times:
 - Create two events (enter and leave) for each customer
 - Sort events by time
 - Go through them, maintain counter of customers, max counter is max number of people

Works in O(nlogn + n), O(nlogn) for sorting and O(n) for processing
