Given NxN chessboard, how many ways to place two queens so they don't attack each other

Can be solved in O(n^4), since n^2 to choose first queen and n^2 - 1 to choose the second queen

A queen always attacks n - 1 squares horizontally and n - 1 squares vertically
For both diagonals it is d - 1 squares

If we know q(n) can we find q(n + 1) for a recursive solution?
q(n) = q(n - 1) + 2(n - 1) ^ 2 * (n - 2)
for an O(n) solution

Or:

q(n) = (n^4) / 2 - (5n^3) / 3 + (3n^2) / 2 - n / 3
